# Frontend Fixes Applied

This document lists the fixes applied to resolve React warnings and errors in the frontend application.

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing `dev` Script
**Problem**: `npm run dev` was not available in frontend package.json
**Solution**: Added `"dev": "react-scripts start"` to the scripts section

### 2. Boolean Attribute Warning
**Problem**: React warning about `jsx` attribute in EmojiReactions component
```
Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `jsx`.
```
**Solution**: Changed `<style jsx>` to `<style>` in EmojiReactions.js

### 3. Touch Event preventDefault Warnings
**Problem**: Warnings about preventDefault in passive event listeners
```
Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation.
```
**Solution**: Removed unnecessary `e.preventDefault()` calls from touch event handlers in Whiteboard.js

## 🔧 Scripts Available

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm start           # Alternative way to start dev server

# Build scripts
npm run build       # Production build with environment variables
npm run build:dev   # Development build
npm run build:prod  # Direct production build

# Utilities
npm run setup-env   # Set up environment variables only
npm test           # Run tests
```

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ Frontend development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend server running on http://localhost:5010
- ✅ WebSocket connection established
- ✅ All React warnings resolved
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

## 📋 Environment Variables

All configuration is now environment-variable driven:
- API URLs
- WebSocket URLs
- Frontend URLs
- AI API configuration

## 🐛 Remaining Notes

- Security vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (non-critical for production)
- WebSocket connection warnings are informational and normal
- Touch events now work without preventDefault warnings

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test all features in the browser
2. Verify real-time collaboration works
3. Test mobile responsiveness
4. Deploy to Railway when ready
