# Socket Connection Fix

## Issue Identified
The frontend was trying to connect to `ws://localhost:3000` instead of `ws://localhost:5010` due to a proxy configuration in `package.json`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed Problematic Proxy Configuration
**File**: `frontend/package.json`
- **Removed**: `"proxy": "http://localhost:5010"`
- **Reason**: This proxy setting was interfering with socket.io connections

### 2. ‚úÖ Verified Backend Connection
- Backend is running correctly on port 5010
- Socket.io server is functioning properly
- Test connection successful (see test results below)

### 3. ‚úÖ Test Results
```bash
$ node test-socket-connection.js
üîç Testing socket connection to: http://localhost:5010
‚úÖ Successfully connected to backend!
   Socket ID: QLdw5eCezs6Qz2YIAAAB
üöÄ Testing room join...
‚úÖ Received users update: [...]
‚úÖ Test completed successfully!
```

## Required Action: Restart Frontend Server

**IMPORTANT**: You need to restart the React development server to pick up the package.json changes.

### Steps:
1. Stop the current React dev server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm start`)
2. Restart it with:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Expected Result:
After restarting, the socket connection should work correctly:
- ‚úÖ Frontend connects to `http://localhost:5010`
- ‚úÖ Real-time collaboration features work
- ‚úÖ Room joining/leaving works
- ‚úÖ Drawing and notes sync between users

## Configuration Details

The socket connection now uses explicit URLs:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5010`
- **Production**: `https://web-production-09dde.up.railway.app`

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/package.json` - Removed proxy configuration
2. `frontend/src/hooks/useSocket.js` - Added connection logging
3. `test-socket-connection.js` - Created test script (can be deleted after testing)

## Status
- ‚úÖ Backend verified working
- ‚úÖ Socket.io server verified working  
- ‚úÖ Proxy configuration removed
- ‚è≥ **Waiting for frontend server restart**
- ‚è≥ Frontend connection verification needed
