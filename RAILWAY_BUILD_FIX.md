# Railway Build Fix

## Issue Identified
The Railway deployment was failing with:
```
sh: react-scripts: not found
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c cd frontend && npm run build:prod" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127
```

## Root Cause
The build process was not installing frontend dependencies before trying to build the React application.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Dockerfile (for Docker builds)
**File**: `Dockerfile`

**Added frontend package.json copy and npm install:**
```dockerfile
# Copy package files for better Docker layer caching
COPY package*.json ./
COPY backend/package*.json ./backend/
COPY frontend/package*.json ./frontend/

# Install root dependencies
RUN npm install

# Install backend dependencies
WORKDIR /app/backend
RUN npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
WORKDIR /app/frontend
RUN npm install

# Go back to app root
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build frontend with production environment variables
WORKDIR /app/frontend
RUN npm run build:prod

# Go back to app root for startup
WORKDIR /app
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed Railway Configuration (for Nixpacks builds)
**Files**: `railway.json` and `railway.toml`

**Updated build command to include frontend dependencies:**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && cd backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run build:prod"
  }
}
```

## Build Process Flow

### Before Fix:
1. ❌ Install only backend dependencies
2. ❌ Try to run `npm run build:prod` in frontend (fails - no react-scripts)

### After Fix:
1. ✅ Install root dependencies
2. ✅ Install backend dependencies  
3. ✅ Install frontend dependencies
4. ✅ Build frontend with production environment variables
5. ✅ Start backend server

## Environment Variables
The production build uses these environment variables:
```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://web-production-09dde.up.railway.app
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://web-production-09dde.up.railway.app  
REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=https://collab-board-jade.vercel.app
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAlZ-GzUfjF-UiVsh9q3zZiNYUA0mMgcd0
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the changes to trigger a new Railway deployment
2. Monitor the build logs to ensure the frontend dependencies install correctly
3. Verify the build completes successfully with the frontend build step

## Expected Results
- ✅ Frontend dependencies install without errors
- ✅ `react-scripts build` command works correctly
- ✅ Production build completes successfully
- ✅ Railway deployment succeeds
- ✅ Application serves both backend API and frontend static files

## Files Modified
1. `Dockerfile` - Added frontend dependency installation and proper working directory management
2. `railway.json` - Updated build command to include frontend build process
3. `railway.toml` - Updated build command to include frontend build process
