# 🛠️ Fixes Applied - Registration & React Router Issues

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Registration "Failed to fetch" Error**

**Problem**: Users were getting a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error when trying to register.

**Root Cause**: 
- API configuration was set to use an empty string in development, relying on proxy
- Proxy wasn't working correctly for requests from `localhost:3001`

**Solution**: 
- Updated `frontend/src/config/api.js` to use direct backend URL in development
- Changed `API_BASE_URL` from `''` to `'http://localhost:5010'` for development
- Enhanced error handling in `AuthContext.js` with detailed logging

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/config/api.js`
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
- `backend/server.js` (added memory store middleware)

### 2. **React Router Deprecation Warnings**

**Problem**: Console showed deprecation warnings about React Router v7 future flags:
- `v7_startTransition` warning
- `v7_relativeSplatPath` warning

**Solution**: 
- Added future flags to BrowserRouter configuration in `App.js`
- Set both `v7_startTransition: true` and `v7_relativeSplatPath: true`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.js`

### 3. **Port Conflicts Clarification**

**Problem**: Error messages about ports already in use when trying to start servers.

**Resolution**: 
- Verified that servers were already running correctly:
  - Backend: `localhost:5010` ✅
  - Frontend: `localhost:3001` ✅ 
- No action needed - servers were working properly

## 🔧 Current Status

| Service | Port | Status | URL |
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| Backend | 5010 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:5010 |
| Frontend | 3001 | ✅ Running | http://localhost:3001 |
| Registration | - | ✅ Working | POST /api/auth/register |
| CORS | - | ✅ Configured | Allows localhost:3001 |

## 🧪 Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified:

1. **Registration Test**: ✅ Successfully creates users and returns JWT tokens
2. **Backend Health**: ✅ API endpoints responding correctly  
3. **Frontend Load**: ✅ React app loads without errors
4. **Router Warnings**: ✅ Deprecation warnings resolved
5. **CORS Headers**: ✅ Proper headers for cross-origin requests

## 📝 Next Steps

The application is now ready for development and testing:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/register` to test registration
2. Use the `/login` endpoint to test authentication
3. All collaboration features should work normally

## 🔗 Additional Notes

- Environment variables are properly configured for development
- Memory store fallback is available if database is unavailable
- Enhanced error logging provides better debugging information
- React Router is future-ready for v7 migration
